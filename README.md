# cna330 nfl datascience project

## Summary
Development outline: Design, develop, and deploy a Database project involving NFL data in our Group Presentation. This project will extract NFL data from a football database and display statistics. We will present with statistics to compare how PAT, also known as a point after touchdown or extra point success rate was from 2014 to 2019. The NFL league moved its extra-point distance to the 15-yard-line, making kickers boot the ball 33 yards for a PAT instead of the old, nearly automatic 20-yard distance in 2015.

Execution: The project will follow an iterative design process, with final delivery set of the system December 6, 2019. The goal is to create a prototype of a NFL extra point kick success rate database with statistics. Data will be researched, pulled, and stored in CSV files. Code will be finished by November 29, 2019. Code will be tested and debugged by November 30, 2019. A group project presentation will be delivered along with any other requested documentation. On December 9, 2019, the project will be complete.
