# cna330 nfl datascience project

## Summary
Development outline: Design, develop, and deploy one (1) Database project involving sports/fantasy sports/sportsball in some way and one (1) Group Presentation. This project will take sports data from a website (such as ESPN API or Yahoo! Fantasy sports API) putting it into a database and querying the database to produce statistics, and using the statistics to make informed game predictions.

Execution: The project will follow an iterative design process, with final delivery set of the system December 6, 2019. The goal is to create a prototype of a sports fantasy database with statistics. Code will be finished by November 29, 2019. Code will be tested and debugged by November 30, 2019. A group project presentation will be delivered along with any other requested documentation. On December 6, 2019, the project will be complete.
